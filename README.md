## LangChain Basic â€“ Learning Repository

This repository is for learning and experimenting with [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/), a powerful framework for building applications with language models.

### Folder: [`Classify-Text-into-Labels`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/classification)

- **Purpose:** This folder contains code and examples for learning about prompt engineering and structured output in LangChain.
- **Focus:**  
  - How to classify user requests using prompts  
  - How to route requests to specialized prompts  
  - How to use structured output models for reliable responses

The code demonstrates a multi-prompt architecture, where user input is classified and routed to the appropriate prompt for processing. This is a practical approach for building modular, maintainable AI applications.
